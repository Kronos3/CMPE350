Question 1:
Text Memory:
    Text memory is where the instructions for the program
    are kept. This portion of memory is usually kept read-only.

Data Memory:
    Data memory is RAM used to store data and can be written
    to and read from arbitrarily.

    You can define/allocate space in the data memory in the
    assembly file by adding to the `.data` section

Integer Registers:
    Integer registers are used by the CPU to do most operations.
    They are used to store data within and across subroutines.

Question 2:
QTSpim replaces the `li $a0, 4` instruction with the equivalent
`ori $a0, $zero, 4` instruction. They are the same because the
`$zero` register will always output `0` and `0 | 4 == 4`.
